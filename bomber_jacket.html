			<h1>What is a Bomber Jacket?</h1>

			<div style="margin: 50px 0;">

			</div>

			<p>
				Bomber Jacket, also known as a flight jacket or bombardier jacket, is a garment that was originally created for use by pilots.
				Since World War I when it made the first appreance, the bomber jacket has grown in popularity throughout the world.
			</p>

			<div id="content" class="grid_7 alpha" style="padding-top: 60px;">
				<h2>In the Past</h2>
				<p>
					Since the majority of airplanes flown in World War-I did not feature enclosed cockpits, pilots had to wear a jacket that
					would keep them warm while also giving them the mobility to fly the plane. In 1915, the Royal Flying Corps pilots began
					wearing long leather coats and the style passed on to the French, American and Belgian military. By the time the United
					States entered World War I in 1917, the government had established the Aviation Clothing Board to provide comfortable
					and warm leather jackets to all pilots. The original bomber jacket featured a high wraparound collar that protected
					the pilot's neck from the wind, zipper closures and snug waists and cuffs to keep the pilot insulated and warm. In addition,
					the jackets were lined with fur.

				<h2>Today</h2>
				<p>
					Today bomber jacket has become a symbol of style, power and leadership with everyone from presidents to executives sporting
					the garment. No longer confined by its military roots, its design has adapted with new stylings to the iconic look.
					The bomber jacket is now a true fashion essential, one found draped across the shoulders of nearly everyone who gives
					any thought to what they wear.

				<h1>Fashion Statement or Just Another Accesory to Stay Warm?</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<p>
					Bomber jacket was initially designed for pilots to keep themselves warm. Therefore the primary question we addressed was
					if that was still true.
				</p>
				<p>We performed analysis to determine if an online query for bomber jacket was to make a potential purchase for fashion
					statement or to make a potential purchase as an accessory to stay warm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following was the hypothesis we addressed
				</p>
				<p>
					Null Hypothesis (H0): Online Queries for Bomber Jacket (from Google Trend) is towards a potential purchase to keep warm
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternate Hypothesis (H1): Online Queries for Bomber Jacket (from Google Trend) is towards a potential purchase for fashion
					statement
					In order to answer this question, we divided countries/regions/cities into two groups: cold and hot. Please refer to <a href="#appendix2">Appendix-2</a> for details on weights.
					The average winter temperature was retrieved from Wikipedia as base to determine weights for classification.
					<br><br>
					Each country/region/city was given a weight based on the average winter temperature. This formed the basic to determine how to categorize.
					Such categorization allowed us to compare the number of queries.  A person querying a bomber jacket from a "hot" country/region/city is obviously shopping for its fashion value adding validity to our alternate hypothesis.

			<p>
			   The chart shows the trend between the categories follow very closely.  
			   We see that even though the number of queries is consistenly higher for cold category (which is quite logical) when compared with hot category both follow an increasing trend.
			   This aligns with our alternate hypothesis that bomber jacket has become a fashion item.

			   As seen from the above chart, the queries for bomber jacket is spread out across the world providing strength to our alternate hypothesis that bomber jacket is now a fashion trend.  
			   Potential buyers are not only showing interest for it's utility, but also for the sense of fashion it brings.

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>

			</div>
			<p>
				Analysis results threw suprising results. Contrary to the general perception the trends for cold and hot cities almost match
				each other. Surprisingly, even though cold cities show larger trend, hot cities follow a similar trend pattern.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result also indicates that bomber jacket is no longer a seasonal item. The searches are consistently high all-year-round,
				meaning it's about style as much as it is utility.
